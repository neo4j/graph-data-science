This is the manual for Neo4j Graph Data Science Library version {docs-version}.
--

The manual covers the following areas:

* <<introduction>> -- An introduction to Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
* <<installation>> -- Instructions for how to install and use the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
* <<common-usage>> -- General usage patterns and recommendations for getting the most out of the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
* <<management-ops>> -- A detailed guide to the graph catalog and utility procedures included in the GDS library.
* <<yelp-example>> -- An illustration of how to use graph algorithms on a social network of friends.
* <<procedures>> -- A list of Neo4j Graph Data Science library procedures.
* <<algorithms-centrality>> -- A detailed guide to each of the centrality algorithms, including use-cases and examples.
* <<algorithms-community>> -- A detailed guide to each of the community detection algorithms, including use-cases and examples.
* <<algorithms-graph-similarity>> -- A detailed guide to each of the similarity detection algorithms, including use-cases and examples.
* <<algorithms-auxiliary>> -- A detailed guide to each of the auxiliary procedures, including use-cases and examples.


In addition to the above algorithms, there are a large number of algorithm implementations developed as part of Neo4j Labs.
These include algorithms in various categories, including categories in which there are officially supported algorithms.
The Neo4j Labs algorithms are documented in <<labs-algorithms>>.
Please note that Neo4j Labs algorithms are not supported for production purposes.
