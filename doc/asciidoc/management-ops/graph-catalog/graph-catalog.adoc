--
This section details the graph catalog operations available to manage named graph projections within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

Graph algorithms run on a graph data model which is a _projection_ of the Neo4j property graph data model.
A graph projection can be seen as a materialized view over the stored graph, containing only analytically relevant, potentially aggregated, topological and property information.
Graph projections are stored entirely in-memory using compressed data structures optimized for topology and property lookup operations.

The graph catalog is a concept within the GDS library that allows managing multiple graph projections by name.
Using its name, a created graph can be used many times in the analytical workflow.
Named graphs can be created using either a <<catalog-graph-create, Native projection>> or a <<catalog-graph-create-cypher, Cypher projection>>.
After usage, named graphs can be removed from the catalog to free up main memory.

Graphs can also be created when running an algorithm without placing them in the catalog.
We refer to such graphs as <<anonymous-graph, anonymous graphs>>.

[NOTE]
====
The graph catalog exists as long as the Neo4j instance is running.
When Neo4j is restarted, graphs stored in the catalog are lost and need to be re-created.

This chapter explains the available graph catalog operations.

| <<graph-catalog-node-ops, gds.graph.writeNodeProperties>>                     | Writes node properties stored in a named graph to Neo4j.
| <<graph-catalog-relationship-ops, gds.graph.writeRelationship>>               | Writes relationships stored in a named graph to Neo4j.
| <<catalog-graph-export-database, gds.graph.export>>                           | Exports a named graph into a new offline Neo4j database.

[NOTE]
====
Creating, using, listing, and dropping named graphs are management operations bound to a Neo4j user.
Graphs created by a different Neo4j user are not accessible at any time.
