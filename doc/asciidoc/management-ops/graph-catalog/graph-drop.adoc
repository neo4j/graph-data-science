= Removing graphs from the catalog

Once we have finished using the named graph we can remove it from the catalog to free up memory.

.Remove a graph from the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.drop('my-store-graph') YIELD graphName;
----

If we want the procedure to fail silently on non-existing graphs, we can set a boolean flag as the second parameter to false.
This will yield an empty result for non-existing graphs.

.Try removing a graph from the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.drop('my-fictive-graph', false) YIELD graphName;
----

If we want to drop a graph created on another database, we can set the database name as the third parameter.
This will yield an empty result for non-existing graphs.
