[.alpha-symbol]
[.tier-note]
Publishing models is an alpha tier feature.

By default, a trained model is visible to the user that created it.
Making a model accessible to other users can be achieved by publishing it.

| modelInfo                                              | shared
| {modelName=my-model_public, modelType=some-model-type} | true

We can see that the model is now shared. The shared model has the `_public` suffix.
