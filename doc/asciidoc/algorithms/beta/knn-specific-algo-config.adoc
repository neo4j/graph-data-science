| Name                                                             | Type    | Default   | Optional | Description
| <<common-configuration-node-weight-property,nodeWeightProperty>> | String  | n/a       | no       | The name of a node property that contains node weights which will be used for similarity computation.
| topK                                                             | Integer | 10        | yes      | The number of neighbors to find for each node. The K-nearest neighbors are returned. This value cannot be lower than 1.
| sampleRate                                                       | Float   | 0.5       | yes      | Sample rate to limit the number of comparisons per node. Value must be between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).
| deltaThreshold                                                   | Float   | 0.001     | yes      | Value as a percentage to determine when to stop early. If fewer updates than the configured value happen, the algorithm stops. Value must be between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).
| <<common-configuration-max-iterations,maxIterations>>            | Integer | 100       | yes      | Hard limit to stop the algorithm after that many iterations.
| randomJoins                                                      | Integer | 10        | yes      | Between every iteration, how many attempts are being made to connect new node neighbors based on random selection.
| <<algorithms-knn-introduction-sampling, initialSampler>>         | String  | "uniform" | yes      | The method used to sample the first `k` random neighbors for each node. "uniform" and "randomWalk", both case-insensitive, are valid inputs.
| randomSeed                                                       | Integer | n/a       | yes      | The seed value to control the randomness of the algorithm. Note that `concurrency` must be set to 1 when setting this parameter.
