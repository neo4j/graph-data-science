| <<common-configuration-max-iterations,maxIterations>>                            | Integer | 10                     | yes      | The maximum number of iterations to run.
| <<common-configuration-node-weight-property,nodeWeightProperty>>                 | String  | null                   | yes      | The name of a node property that contains node weights.
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String  | null                   | yes      | If set, the values stored at the given property are used as relationship weights during the computation. If not set, the graph is considered unweighted.
| <<common-configuration-seed-property,seedProperty>>                              | String  | n/a                    | yes      | The name of a node property that defines an initial numeric label.
