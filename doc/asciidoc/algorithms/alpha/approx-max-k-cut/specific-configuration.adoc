| Name                                                                             | Type    | Default     | Optional | Description
| k                                                                                | Integer | 2           | yes      | The number of disjoint communities the nodes will be divided into.
| <<algorithms-approx-max-k-cut-iterations, iterations>>                           | Integer | 8           | yes      | The number of iterations the algorithm will run before returning the best solution among all the iterations.
| <<algorithms-approx-max-k-cut-vns-order, vnsMaxNeighborhoodOrder>>               | Integer | 0 (VNS off) | yes      | The maximum number of nodes VNS will swap when perturbing solutions.
| randomSeed                                                                       | Integer | n/a         | yes      | A random seed which is used for all randomness in computing the embeddings. Will only yield deterministic behavior when `concurrency = 1`.
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String  | null        | yes      | If set, the values stored at the given property are used as relationship weights during the computation. If not set, the graph is considered unweighted.
