| Name                 | Type          | Default   | Optional | Description
| modelName            | String        | n/a       | no       | The name of the model to train.
| embeddingSize        | Integer       | 64        | yes      | The dimension of the generated node embeddings as well as their hidden layer representations.
| aggregator           | String        | "mean"    | yes      | What aggregator to be used by the layers. Supported values are "mean" and "pool".
| activationFunction   | String        | "sigmoid" | yes      | The activation function to be used in the model architecture. Supported values are "sigmoid" and "relu".
| sampleSizes          | List<Integer> | [25, 10]  | yes      | An array of Integer values, the size of the array determines the number of layers and the values determine how many nodes will be sampled by the layers.
| nodePropertyNames    | List<String>  | []        | yes      | An array of node property names. The in-memory graph has to be created with a super-set of these property names.
| batchSize            | Integer       | 100       | yes      | The number of nodes per batch.
| tolerance            | Float         | 1e-4      | yes      | Tolerance controls the training cycles. The training will complete when loss changes less than `tolerance` which may happen before the epochs and/or maxOptimizationIterations are exhausted.
| learningRate         | Float         | 0.1       | yes      | Controls the size of updates during training.
| epochs               | Integer       | 1         | yes      | Number of times to traverse the graph during training.
| maxIterations        | Integer       | 10        | yes      | Maximum number of parameter updates per epoch and batch.
| searchDepth          | Integer       | 5         | yes      | Depth of a RandomWalk when sampling neighbors during training. This is used when computing the loss function.
| negativeSampleWeight | Integer       | 20        | yes      | The weight of the negative samples. This is used when computing the loss function.
| degreeAsProperty     | Boolean       | false     | yes      | Whether or not to use the degree of the node as node property.
5+| *Note*: At least one of `nodePropertyNames` and `degreeAsProperty` have to be specified.
