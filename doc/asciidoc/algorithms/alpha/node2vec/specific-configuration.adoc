| Name                    | Type    | Default | Optional | Description
| walkLength              | Integer | 80      | yes      | Number of steps in a random walk.
| walksPerNode            | Integer | 10      | yes      | Number of random walks to starting at each node.
| windowSize              | Integer | 10      | yes      | Size of the context window when training the neural network.
| walkBufferSize          | Integer | 1000    | yes      | Number of random walks to complete before starting training.
| inOutFactor             | Float   | 1.0     | yes      | Tendency of the random walk to stay close to the start node or fan out in the graph. Higher value means stay local.
| returnFactor            | Float   | 1.0     | yes      | Tendency of the random walk to return to the last visited node. A value below 1.0 means a higher tendency.
| negativeSamplingRate    | Integer | 5       | yes      | Number of negative samples to produce for each positive sample.
| centerSamplingFactor    | Float   | 0.001   | yes      | Factor for influencing the sampling distribution for center words. A higher value increases the probability that frequent words are down-sampled.
| contextSamplingExponent | Float   | 0.75    | yes      | Exponent applied to the context word frequency to obtain the context word sampling distribution. A value of 1.0 samples proportionally to the frequency distribution. A value of 0.0 samples each word equally.
| embeddingDimension      | Integer | 128     | yes      | Size of the computed node embeddings. Denoted by `dimensions` in the Node2Vec paper.
| initialLearningRate     | Float   | 0.01    | yes      | Learning rate used initially for training the neural network. The learning rate decreases during training.
| minLearningRate         | Float   | 0.0001  | yes      | Lower bound for learning rate as it is decreased during training.
| iterations              | Integer | 1       | yes      | Number of training iterations.
