| Name                  | Type      | Default | Optional | Description
| trainRelationshipType | String    | n/a     | no       | Relationship type to use during model training.
| testRelationshipType  | String    | n/a     | no       | Relationship type to use during model evaluation.
| validationFolds       | Integer   | n/a     | no       | Number of divisions of the training graph used during model selection.
| negativeClassWeight   | Float     | n/a     | no       | Weight of negative examples in model evaluation. Positive examples have weight 1.

| Name          | Type    | Default         | Optional | Description
| batchSize     | Integer | 100             | yes      | Number of nodes per batch.
| minEpochs     | Integer | 1               | yes      | Minimum number of training epochs.
| maxEpochs     | Integer | 100             | yes      | Maximum number of training epochs.
| patience      | Integer | 1               | yes      | Maximum number of unproductive consecutive epochs.
| tolerance     | Float   | 0.001           | yes      | Epochs that do not improve the loss by a factor of 1 - `tolerance` are considered unproductive.
| sharedUpdater | Boolean | false           | yes      | Whether to use a shared ADAM optimizer across training threads.
| concurrency   | Integer | see description | yes      | Concurrency for training the model candidate. By default the value of the top level `concurrency` parameter is used.
