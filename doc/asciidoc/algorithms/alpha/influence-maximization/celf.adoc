[[alpha-algorithms-celf-intro]]
== Introduction
The CELF algorithm for Influence Maximization aims to find `k` nodes that maximize the expected spread of influence in the network.
It simulates the influence spread using the Independent Cascade model, which calculates the expected spread by taking the average spread over the `mc` Monte-Carlo simulations. In the propagation process, a node is influenced in case that a uniform random draw is less than the probability `p`.

Leskovec et al. 2007 introduced CELF algorithm in their study "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/pubs/detect-kdd07.pdf[Cost-effective Outbreak Detection in Networks]" to deal with the NP-hard problem of Influence Maximization on the basis of the "lazy-forward" optimization.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (a:Person {name: 'Jimmy'}),
  (b:Person {name: 'Jack'}),
  (c:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (d:Person {name: 'Ceri'}),
  (e:Person {name: 'Mohammed'}),
  (f:Person {name: 'Michael'}),
  (g:Person {name: 'Ethan'}),
  (h:Person {name: 'Lara'}),
  (i:Person {name: 'Amir'}),
  (j:Person {name: 'Willie'}),

  (b)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(c),
  (c)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(a),
  (c)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(g),
  (c)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(h),
  (c)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(i),
  (c)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(j),
  (d)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(g),
  (f)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(e),
  (f)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(g),
  (g)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(a),
  (g)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(b),
  (g)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(h),
  (g)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(e),
  (h)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(i);
----

In the example, we will use the CELF algorithm to find `k` nodes subset.

.The following statement will create the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=graph-create-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
  'myGraph',
  'Person',
  'FRIEND_OF'
);
----

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the CELF algorithm on this graph.


[[alpha-algorithms-celf-examples-stream]]
=== Stream

In the `stream` execution mode, the algorithm returns the {result} for each node.
This allows us to inspect the results directly or post-process them in Cypher without any side effects.

For more details on the `stream` mode in general, see <<running-algos-stream>>.

.The following will run the algorithm, and stream results:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.alpha.greedy.stream('myGraph', {k: 3, concurrency: 4})
YIELD nodeId, spreadGain
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, spreadGain
ORDER BY spreadGain ASC
----

| "Alice"   | 1.519
| "Ethan"   | 2.701
