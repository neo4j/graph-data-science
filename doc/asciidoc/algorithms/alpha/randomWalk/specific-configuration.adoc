| Name                                                                              | Type    | Default | Optional | Description
| walkLength                                                                        | Integer | 80      | yes      | The number of steps in a single random walk.
| walksPerNode                                                                      | Integer | 10      | yes      | The number of random walks generated for each node.
| inOutFactor                                                                       | Float   | 1.0     | yes      | Tendency of the random walk to stay close to the start node or fan out in the graph. Higher value means stay local.
| returnFactor                                                                      | Float   | 1.0     | yes      | Tendency of the random walk to return to the last visited node. A value below 1.0 means a higher tendency.
| returnPath                                                                        | Boolean | false   | yes      | If this parameter is set to `true` the returned stream result will include a virtual path for each random walk, otherwise the returned object is null.
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>>  | String  | null    | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights to influence the probabilities of the random walks. The weights need to be >= 0. If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
| randomSeed                                                                        | Integer | random  | yes      | Seed value for the random number generator used to generate the random walks.
| walkBufferSize                                                                    | Integer | 1000    | yes      | The number of random walks to complete before starting training.
