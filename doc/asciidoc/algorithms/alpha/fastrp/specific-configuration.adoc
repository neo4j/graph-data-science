| Name                    | Type          | Default   | Optional  | Description
| embeddingDimension      | Integer       | n/a       | no        | The dimension of the computed node embeddings.
| sparsity                | Integer       | 3         | yes       | The expected proportion of non-zero elements in the initial random vectors is `1/sparsity`.
| maxIterations           | Integer       | n/a       | no        | The number of iterations to run. Each iteration produces an intermediate embedding per node.
| iterationWeights        | List<Float>   | []        | yes       | Controls how much each intermediate embedding from an iteration contributes to the final embedding.
| normalizationStrength   | Float         | 0         | yes       | The initial random vector for each node is scaled by its degree to the power of `normalizationStrength`.
| normalizeL2             | Boolean       | false     | yes       | Whether the intermediate embeddings produced at each iteration should be l2 normalized.
5+| If `iterationWeights` is non-empty, then its length must be the same as `maxIterations`.
5+| If `iterationWeights` is empty, then the resulting each node embedding is a concatenation of its intermediate embeddings.
