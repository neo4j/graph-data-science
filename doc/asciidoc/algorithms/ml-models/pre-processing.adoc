= Pre-processing

In most machine learning scenarios, several pre-processing steps are applied to produce data that is amenable to machine learning algorithms.
This is also true for graph data.
The goal of pre-processing is to provide good features for the learning algorithm.
In GDS some options include:

* <<algorithms-node-embeddings, Node embeddings>>
* <<algorithms-centrality, Centrality algorithms>>
* <<algorithms-auxiliary, Auxiliary algorithms>>
** Of special interest are <<algorithms-scale-properties, Scale Properties>> and
** <<algorithms-split-relationships, Split Relationships>> for <<algorithms-ml-linkprediction, Link Prediction>>.
