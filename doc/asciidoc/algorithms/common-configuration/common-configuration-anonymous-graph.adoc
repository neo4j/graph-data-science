| nodeProjection         | String, String[] or Map | null                   | yes      | The node projection used for anonymous graph creation via a Native projection.
| relationshipProjection | String, String[] or Map | null                   | yes      | The relationship projection used for anonymous graph creation a Native projection.
| nodeQuery              | String                  | null                   | yes      | The Cypher query used to select the nodes for anonymous graph creation via a Cypher projection.
| relationshipQuery      | String                  | null                   | yes      | The Cypher query used to select the relationships for anonymous graph creation via a Cypher projection.
| nodeProperties         | String, String[] or Map | null                   | yes      | The node properties to project during anonymous graph creation.
| relationshipProperties | String, String[] or Map | null                   | yes      | The relationship properties to project during anonymous graph creation.
| concurrency            | Integer                 | 4                      | yes      | The number of concurrent threads used for running the algorithm. Also provides the default value for 'readConcurrency' and 'writeConcurrency'.
| readConcurrency        | Integer                 | value of 'concurrency' | yes      | The number of concurrent threads used for creating the graph.
| writeConcurrency       | Integer                 | value of 'concurrency' | yes      | WRITE mode only: The number of concurrent threads used for writing the result.
| writeProperty          | String                  | n/a                    | no       | WRITE mode only: The {entity} property to which the {result} is written to.
