| Name                   | Type        | Default                | Optional | Description
| concurrency            | Integer     | 4                      | yes      | The number of concurrent threads used for running the algorithm. Also provides the default value for 'readConcurrency' and 'writeConcurrency'.
| readConcurrency        | Integer     | value of 'concurrency' | yes      | The number of concurrent threads used for reading the graph.
| writeConcurrency       | Integer     | value of 'concurrency' | yes      | The number of concurrent threads used for writing the result (applicable in WRITE mode).
| nodeProjection         | Map or List | null                   | yes      | The node projection used for implicit graph loading or filtering nodes of an explicitly loaded graph.
| relationshipProjection | Map or List | null                   | yes      | The relationship projection used for implicit graph loading or filtering relationship of an explicitly loaded graph.
| nodeQuery              | String      | null                   | yes      | The Cypher query used to select the nodes for implicit graph loading via a Cypher projection.
| relationshipQuery      | String      | null                   | yes      | The Cypher query used to select the relationships for implicit graph loading via a Cypher projection.
| nodeProperties         | Map or List | null                   | yes      | The node properties to load during implicit graph loading.
| relationshipProperties | Map or List | null                   | yes      | The relationship properties to load during implicit graph loading.
