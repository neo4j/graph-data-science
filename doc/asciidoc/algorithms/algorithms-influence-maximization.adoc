The objective of Influence Maximization is to find a small subset of k nodes from a network in order to achieve maximization to the total number of nodes influenced by these k nodes.
The Neo4j GDS library includes the following alpha influence maximization algorithms:

* Alpha
** <<algorithms-greedy, Greedy>>
** <<algorithms-celf, CELF>>
