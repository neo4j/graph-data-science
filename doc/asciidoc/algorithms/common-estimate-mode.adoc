For memory estimation on a named graph the configuration for creating that graph is used.
For the anonymous graph, configuration is used as for <<native-projection>> or <<cypher-projection>>.
The graph estimation on an anonymous graph is based on the configuration pertaining to anonymous creation or so-called fictive estimation controlled by the options in the table below.

.Configuration
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1m,1,4"]
|===
| Name              | Type    | Default | Optional | Description
| nodeCount         | Integer | -1      | yes      | The number of nodes in a fictive graph.
| relationshipCount | Integer | -1      | yes      | The number of relationships in a fictive graph.
|===

Setting the `nodeCount` and `relationshipCount` parameters results in fictive graph estimation which allows a memory estimation without loading the graph.
Additionally algorithm specific parameters can also be provided as config which influence the estimation of memory usage specific to the algorithm.
