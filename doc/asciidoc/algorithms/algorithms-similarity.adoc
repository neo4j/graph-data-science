Similarity algorithms can help calculate the similarity of nodes.
The Neo4j GDS library includes the following similarity algorithms, grouped by quality tier:

* Production-quality:
** <<algorithms-node-similarity, Node Similarity>>
* Alpha
** <<labs-algorithms-approximate-nearest-neighbors, Approximate Nearest Neighbors>>
** <<labs-algorithms-similarity-cosine, Cosine Similarity>>
** <<labs-algorithms-similarity-euclidean, Euclidean Similarity>>
** <<labs-algorithms-similarity-jaccard, Jaccard Similarity>>
** <<labs-algorithms-similarity-overlap, Overlap Similarity>>
** <<labs-algorithms-similarity-pearson, Pearson Similarity>>
