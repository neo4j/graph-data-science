| Name                                                                             | Type                     | Default   | Optional | Description
| dampingFactor                                                                    | Float                    | 0.85      | yes      | The damping factor of the Page Rank calculation. Must be in [0, 1).
| <<common-configuration-max-iterations,maxIterations>>                            | Integer                  | 20        | yes      | The maximum number of iterations of Article Rank to run.
| <<common-configuration-tolerance,tolerance>>                                     | Float                    | 0.0000001 | yes      | Minimum change in scores between iterations. If all scores change less than the tolerance value the result is considered stable, and the algorithm returns.
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String                   | null      | yes      | If set, the values stored at the given property are used as relationship weights during the computation. If not set, the graph is considered unweighted.
| sourceNodes                                                                      | List or Node or Number   | []        | yes      | The nodes or node ids to use for computing Personalized Page Rank.
| scaler                                                                           | String                   | None      | yes      | The name of the scaler applied for the final scores. Supported values are `None`, `MinMax`, `Max`, `Mean`, `Log`, `L1Norm`, `L2Norm` and `StdScore`.
