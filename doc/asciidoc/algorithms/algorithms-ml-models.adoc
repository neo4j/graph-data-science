This chapter provides explanations and examples for the supervised machine learning models in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

The machine learning procedures in Neo4j GDS allow you to train supervised machine learning models.
Models can then be accessed via the <<model-catalog-ops, Model Catalog>> and used to make predictions about your graph.

To help with working with the ML models, there are additional guides for pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning available in:

* <<algorithms-ml-models-preprocessing, Pre-processing>>
* <<algorithms-ml-models-tuning, Tuning parameters for training>>

The Neo4j GDS library includes the following machine learning models, grouped by quality tier:

* Alpha
** <<algorithms-ml-nodeclassification, Node Classification>>
** <<algorithms-ml-linkprediction, Link Prediction>>
