[abstract]
--
This section describes how to estimate memory requirements for the projected graph model used by the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

The graph algorithms library operates completely on the heap, which means we'll need to configure our Neo4j Server with a much larger heap size than we would for transactional workloads.
The diagram belows shows how memory is used by the projected graph model:

The model contains three types of data:

* Node ids - up to 2^45^ ("35 trillion")
* Relationships - pairs of node ids. Relationships are stored twice if `orientation: "UNDIRECTED"` is used.
* Weights - stored as doubles (8 bytes per node) in an array-like data structure next to the relationships

Memory configuration depends on the graph projection that we're using.

This section includes:

* <<estimate-procedure-algo>>
* <<estimate-procedure-graph>>
* <<estimate-heap-control>>

== Estimating memory requirements for algorithms

In many use cases it will be useful to estimate the required memory of a graph and an algorithm before running it in order to make sure that the workload can run on the available hardware.
To make this process easier every algorithm supports the `.estimate` mode, which returns an estimate of the amount of memory required to run graph algorithms.

.Syntax
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.<ALGO>.<MODE>.estimate(graphNameOrConfig: String|Map, configuration: Map)
YIELD requiredMemory, treeView, mapView, bytesMin, bytesMax, heapPercentageMin, heapPercentageMax, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name              | Type          | Default   | Optional  | Description
| graphNameOrConfig | String or Map | -         | no        | The name of the projected graph or the algorithm configuration in case of implicit loading.
| configuration     | Map           | {}        | yes       | If the first parameter is the name of a projected graph, this parameter is the algorithm config, otherwise it needs to be null or an empty map.
|===

The configuration parameter accepts the same configuration parameters as the estimated algorithm.
See the algorithm documentation for more information.

[[estimate-procedure-graph]]
== Estimating memory requirements for graphs

The <<catalog-graph-create, `gds.graph.create`>> procedures also support `.estimate` to estimate memory usage for just the graph.
Those procedures don't accept the graph name as the first argument, as they don't actually create the graph.

.Syntax
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create.estimate(nodeProjection: String|List|Map, relationshipProjection: String|List|Map, configuration: Map})
YIELD requiredMemory, treeView, mapView, bytesMin, bytesMax, heapPercentageMin, heapPercentageMax, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

The `nodeProjection` and `relationshipProjection` parameters follow the same syntax as in <<catalog-graph-create, `gds.graph.create`>>.

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name                   | Type                  | Default   | Optional  | Description
| nodeProjection         | String or List or Map | -         | no        | The node projection to estimate for.
| relationshipProjection | String or List or Map | -         | no        | The relationship projection to estimate for.
| configuration          | Map                   | {}        | yes       | Additional configuration, such as concurrency.
|===

The result of running `gds.graph.create.estimate` has the same form as the algorithm memory estimation results above.

It is also possible to estimate the memory of a fictive graph, by explicitly specifying its node and relationship count.
Using this feature, one can estimate the memory consumption of an arbitrarily sized graph.

To achieve this, use the following configuration options:

.Configuration
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name              | Type      | Default           | Optional  | Description
| nodeCount         | Integer   | 0                 | yes       | The number of nodes in a fictive graph.
| relationshipCount | Integer   | 0                 | yes       | The number of relationships in a fictive graph.
|===

When estimating a fictive graph, syntactically valid `nodeProjection` and `relationshipProjection` must be specified.
However, it is recommended to specify `'*'` for both in the fictive graph case as this does not interfere with the specified values above.

The query below is an example of estimating a fictive graph with 100 nodes and 1000 relationships.

.Example
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create.estimate('*', '*', {
  nodeCount: 100,
  relationshipCount: 1000,
  nodeProperties: 'foo',
  relationshipProperties: 'bar'
})
YIELD requiredMemory, treeView, mapView, bytesMin, bytesMax, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="2,1,1,1,1"]
|===
| requiredMemory          | bytesMin | bytesMax | nodeCount | relationshipCount
| "[561 KiB ... 564 KiB]" | 574712   | 577896   | 100       | 1000
|===

The <<cypher-projection, `gds.graph.create.cypher`>> procedure has to execute both, the `nodeQuery` and `relationshipQuery`, in order to count the number of nodes and relationships of the graph.

.Syntax
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create.cypher.estimate(nodeQuery: String, relationshipQuery: String, configuration: Map})
YIELD requiredMemory, treeView, mapView, bytesMin, bytesMax, heapPercentageMin, heapPercentageMax, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name              | Type   | Default   | Optional  | Description
| nodeQuery         | String | -         | no        | The node query to estimate for.
| relationshipQuery | String | -         | no        | The relationship query to estimate for.
| configuration     | Map    | {}        | yes       | Additional configuration, such as concurrency.

[[estimate-heap-control]]
== Automatic estimation and execution blocking
All algorithm procedures in the GDS library and the graph creation procedures will do an estimation check before executing.
This includes the modes `write`, `stream`, `stats` and `mutate` but not the estimate modes.

If the estimation check can determine that the current amount of free memory is insufficient to carry through the operation, the operation will be aborted and an error will be reported.
The error will contain details of the estimation and the free memory at the time of estimation.

This heap control logic is restrictive in the sense that it only blocks executions that are certain to not fit into memory.
It does not guarantee that an execution that passed the heap control will succeed without depleting memory.
Thus, it is still useful to first run the estimation mode before running an algorithm or graph creation on a large data set.

The free memory taken into consideration is based on the Java runtime system information.
The amount of free memory can be increased by either  <<catalog-graph-drop, dropping>> unused graphs from the catalog, or by <<heap-size, increasing the maximum heap size>> prior to starting the Neo4j instance.
