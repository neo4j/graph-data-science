= Community detection algorithms

[abstract]
--
This chapter provides explanations and examples for each of the community detection algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.
--

The following community detection algorithms evaluate how a group is clustered or partitioned, as well as its tendency to strengthen or break apart:

* <<algorithms-louvain, Louvain>> (`algo.louvain`)
* <<algorithms-label-propagation, Label Propagation>> (`algo.labelPropagation`)
* <<algorithms-connected-components, Connected Components>> (`algo.unionFind`)
