= Algorithms

The Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library contains many graph algorithms.
The algorithms are divided into categories which represent different problem classes.
The categories are listed in this chapter.

Algorithms exist in one of three tiers of maturity:

* Production-quality
** Indicates that the algorithm has been tested with regards to stability and scalability.
** Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.<algorithm>`.
* Beta
** Indicates that the algorithm is a candidate for the production-quality tier.
** Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.beta.<algorithm>`.
* Alpha
** Indicates that the algorithm is experimental and might be changed or removed at any time.
** Algorithms in this tier are prefixed with `gds.alpha.<algorithm>`.

This chapter is divided into the following sections:

* <<algorithms-syntax>>
* <<algorithms-centrality>>
* <<algorithms-community>>
* <<algorithms-graph-similarity>>
* <<algorithms-path-finding>>
* <<algorithms-auxiliary>>
* <<labs-algorithms>>
