.Changes in configuration parameter map
[opts=header,cols="1,1"]
|===
|Graph Algorithms v3.5 |Graph Data Science v1.0
|`write: true` | Replaced by dedicated `write` mode
|`graph: 'cypher'\|'huge'` | Removed. Always using `huge` graph footnote:graph-param[Graph creation with cypher queries has dedicate `gds.graph.create.cypher` procedure. There are parameters `nodeQuery` and `relationshipQuery` for anonymous graphs]
|`direction` | Replaced by `projection` parameter of `relationshipProjection`
|`direction: 'OUTGOING'` | `orientation: 'NATURAL'`
|`direction: 'INCOMING'` | `orientation: 'REVERSE'`
|`direction: 'BOTH'` | Removed footnote:direction-both[This behaviour can be achieved by creating two relationship projections - one with `orientation: 'NATURAL'` and one with `orientation: 'REVERSE'`. See <<direction-both-example, this example>>]
|`undirected: true` | Replaced by `orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'` parameter of `relationshipProjection`
|`duplicateRelationships` | Replaced by `aggregation` parameter of `relationshipProjection`
|`duplicateRelationships: 'SKIP'` | `aggregation: 'SINGLE'`
|`iterations` | `maxIterations`
