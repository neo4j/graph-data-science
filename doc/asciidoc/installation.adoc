This chapter provides instructions for installation and basic usage of the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

The Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library is delivered as a plugin to the Neo4j Graph Database.
The plugin needs to be installed into the database and whitelisted in the Neo4j configuration.
There are two main ways of achieving this, which we will detail in this chapter.


== Supported Neo4j versions

The GDS library supports the following Neo4j versions:

[opts=header]

|===


== Neo4j Desktop

The most convenient way of installing the GDS library is through the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/neo4j-desktop/index.html[Neo4j Desktop^] plugin called Neo4j Graph Data Science.
The plugin can be found in the 'Plugins' tab of a database.

image::neo4j-desktop-gds.png[width=500]

The installer will download the GDS library and install it in the 'plugins' directory of the database.
It will also add the following entry to the settings file:

----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----

This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.

If the procedure whitelist is configured, make sure to also include procedures from the GDS library:

----
dbms.security.procedures.whitelist=gds.*
----

== Neo4j Server

The GDS library is intended to be used on a standalone Neo4j server.

[NOTE]
====
Running the GDS library in a Neo4j Causal Cluster is not supported.
Read more about how to use GDS in conjunction with Neo4j Causal Cluster deployment <<installation-causal-cluster, below>>.
====

On a standalone Neo4j Server, the library will need to be installed and configured manually.

1. Download `neo4j-graph-data-science-[version].jar` from the https://neo4j.com/download-center/#algorithms[Neo4j Download Center] and copy it into the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory.


2. Add the following to your `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` file:
+
----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----
This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.
+

3. Check if the procedure whitelist is enabled in the `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` file and add the GDS library if necessary:
+
----
dbms.security.procedures.whitelist=gds.*
----
+

4. Restart Neo4j


=== Verifying installation

To verify your installation, the library version can be printed by entering into the browser in Neo4j Desktop and calling the `gds.version()` function:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
RETURN gds.version()
----

To list all installed algorithms, run the `gds.list()` procedure:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.list()
----

[[installation-enterprise-edition]]
== Enterprise Edition Configuration

Unlocking the Enterprise Edition of the Neo4j Graph Data Science library requires a valid license key.
To register for a license, please contact Neo4j at https://neo4j.com/contact-us/?ref=graph-analytics.

The license is issued in the form of a license key file, which needs to be placed in a directory accessible by the Neo4j server.
You can configure the location of the license key file by setting the `gds.enterprise.license_file` option in the `neo4j.conf` configuration file of your Neo4j installation.
The location must be specified using an absolute path.
It is necessary to restart the database when configuring the license key for the first time and every time the license key is changed, e.g., when a new license key is added or the location of the key file changes.


Example configuration for the license key file:
----
gds.enterprise.license_file=/path/to/my/license/keyfile
----

If the `gds.enterprise.license_file` setting is set to a non-empty value, the Neo4j Graph Data Science library will verify that the license key file is accessible and contains a valid license key.
When a valid license key is configured, all Enterprise Edition features are unlocked.
In case of a problem, e.g, when the license key file is inaccessible, the license has expired or is invalid for any other reason, all calls to the Neo4j Graph Data Science Library will result in an error, stating the problem with the license key.

[[installation-docker]]
== Neo4j Docker

The Neo4j Graph Data Science library is available as a plugin for Neo4j on Docker.
The plugins guide for Docker is found at the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/docker/operations/#docker-neo4jlabs-plugins[operations manual].

To run a Neo4j Container with GDS available, you can run

[source,shell]
----
docker run -it --rm \
  --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
  --user="$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=none \
  --env NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS='["graph-data-science"]' \
  neo4j:4.2
----

[[installation-causal-cluster]]
== Neo4j Causal Cluster

A Neo4j Causal Cluster consists of multiple machines that together support a highly available database management system.
The GDS library uses main memory on a single machine for hosting graphs in the graph catalog and computing algorithms over these.
These two architectures are not compatible and should not be used in conjunction.
A GDS workload will attempt to consume most of the system resources of the machine during runtime, which may make the machine unresponsive for extended periods of time.
For these reasons, we strongly advise against running GDS in a cluster as this potentially leads to data corruption or cluster outage.

To make use of GDS on graphs hosted by a Neo4j Causal Cluster deployment, these graphs should be detached from the running cluster.
This can be accomplished in several ways, including:

1. Dumping a snapshot of the Neo4j store and importing it in a separate standalone Neo4j server.
2. Adding a Read Replica to the Neo4j Causal Cluster and then detaching it to safely operate GDS on a snapshot in separation from the Neo4j Causal Cluster.
3. Adding a Read Replica to the Neo4j Causal Cluster and configuring it for GDS workloads.
Be aware that the in-memory graph and the underlying database will eventually become out of sync due to updates to the Read Replica.
Since GDS can consume all available resources, responsiveness of the Read Replica might decrease and its state might fall behind the cluster.
Using GDS in this scenario requires:
** installing GDS on the Read Replica
** using mutate or stream invocation modes
** consuming results from GDS workloads directly via Cypher (see <<utility-functions-catalog, Utility functions>>)
** *not using GDS write-back features* (writing triggers many large transactions and will potentially terminate the cluster)

After the GDS workload has finished on a detached machine (for cases 1. and 2.) it now contains out-of-sync results written to its copied version of the graph from the Neo4j Causal Cluster.
To integrate these results back to the cluster, custom programs are necessary.

[[additional-config-parameters]]
== Additional configuration options

In order to make use of certain features of the GDS library, additional configuration is necessary.
Configuration is done in the _neo4j.conf_ configuration file before starting the DBMS.
The following features require such additional configuration:


=== Graph export

Exporting <<catalog-graph-export-csv, graphs to CSV>> files requires the configuration parameter `gds.export.location` to be set to the absolut path to the folder in which exported graphs will be stored.
This directory has to be writable by the Neo4j process.


=== Model persistence

The <<model-catalog-store-ops, model persistence feature>> requires the configuration parameter `gds.model.store_location` to be set to the absolut path to the folder in which the models will be stored.
This directory has to be writable by the Neo4j process.
