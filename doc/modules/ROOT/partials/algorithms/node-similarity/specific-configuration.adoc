Values must be between 0 and 1.
| degreeCutoff                                                                     | Integer | 1       | yes      | Lower limit on the node degree for a node to be considered in the comparisons.
This value can not be lower than 1.
| upperDegreeCutoff                                                                     | Integer | 2147483647       | yes      | Upper bound on the node degree for a node to be considered in the comparisons.
This value can not be lower than 1.
| topK                                                                             | Integer | 10      | yes      | Limit on the number of scores per node.
The K largest results are returned.
This value cannot be lower than 1.
| bottomK                                                                          | Integer | 10      | yes      | Limit on the number of scores per node.
The K smallest results are returned.
This value cannot be lower than 1.
| topN                                                                             | Integer | 0       | yes      | Global limit on the number of scores computed.
The N largest total results are returned.
This value cannot be negative, a value of 0 means no global limit.
| bottomN                                                                          | Integer | 0       | yes      | Global limit on the number of scores computed.
The N smallest total results are returned.
This value cannot be negative, a value of 0 means no global limit.
| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-relationship-weight-property[relationshipWeightProperty] | String  | null    | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights.
If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
| similarityMetric
| String | JACCARD       | yes      |  The metric used to compute similarity.
Can be either `JACCARD` or `OVERLAP`.
