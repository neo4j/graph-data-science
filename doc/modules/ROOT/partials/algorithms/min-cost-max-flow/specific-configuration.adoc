| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-relationship-weight-property[capacityProperty] | String          | n/a | no | Name of the relationship property to use as capacity.

| sourceNodes | List of Nodes or Integers or List of pairs Node or Integer and Scalar | n/a | no | Source nodes given as nodes or node ids. Can be paired with a scalar limiting the out-flow/supply per node like [ [src1, supply1], [src2, supply2],... ].

| targetNodes | List of Nodes or Integers or List of pairs Node or Integer and Scalar | n/a | no | Target nodes given as nodes or node ids. Can be paired with a scalar limiting the in-flow/demand per node like [ [tgt1, demand1], [tgt2, demand2],... ].

| alpha | Integer | 6 | yes | Rate of cost-scaling in the refinement phase of the algorithm. Tuning can improve speed.
