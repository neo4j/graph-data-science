======

[.include-with-mutate]
======

The mutate mode creates new relationships in the projected graph.
Each relationship represents a path from the source node to the target node.
The total cost of a path is stored via the `totalCost` relationship property.

.Run {algorithm} in mutate mode on a named graph.

======

[.include-with-write]
======

The write mode creates new relationships in the Neo4j database.
Each relationship represents a path from the source node to the target node.
Additional path information is stored using relationship properties.
By default, the write mode stores a `totalCost` property.
Optionally, one can also store `nodeIds` and `costs` of intermediate nodes on the path.

.Run {algorithm} in write mode on a named graph.
