| returnFactor                                                                      | Float   | 1.0     | yes      | Tendency of the random walk to return to the last visited node. A value below 1.0 means a higher tendency.
| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-relationship-weight-property[relationshipWeightProperty]  | String  | null    | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights to influence the probabilities of the random walks. The weights need to be >= 0. If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
| windowSize                                                                        | Integer | 10      | yes      | Size of the context window when training the neural network.

| positiveSamplingFactor                                                            | Float   | 0.001   | yes      | Factor for influencing the distribution for positive samples. A higher value increases the probability that frequent nodes are down-sampled.
| negativeSamplingExponent                                                          | Float   | 0.75    | yes      | Exponent applied to the node frequency to obtain the negative sampling distribution. A value of 1.0 samples proportionally to the frequency. A value of 0.0 samples each node equally.

| walkBufferSize                                                                    | Integer | 1000    | yes      | The number of random walks to complete before starting training.
