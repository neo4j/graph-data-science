[[ml-preprocessing]]
= Pre-processing

In most machine learning scenarios, several pre-processing steps are applied to produce data that is amenable to machine learning algorithms.
This is also true for graph data.
The goal of pre-processing is to provide good features for the learning algorithm. As part of our pipelines we offer adding such pre-procesing steps as node property steps (see xref:machine-learning/node-property-prediction/nodeclassification-pipelines/config.adoc#nodeclassification-pipelines-adding-node-properties[Node Classification] or xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/config.adoc#linkprediction-adding-node-properties[Link Prediction]).

In GDS some options include:

* xref:algorithms/centrality.adoc[Centrality algorithms]
* xref:algorithms/auxiliary.adoc[Auxiliary algorithms]
** Of special interest is xref:algorithms/scale-properties.adoc[Scale Properties]
