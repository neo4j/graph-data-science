:description: This chapter provides instructions for installation and basic usage of the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


The Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library is delivered as a plugin to the Neo4j Graph Database.
The plugin needs to be installed into the database and configured.

[NOTE]
====
xref:installation/gds-sessions.adoc[GDS Sessions] is the new fully managed, on-demand analytics-as-a-service offering in Neo4j Aura.

link:https://neo4j.com/data-science-sandbox/[Neo4j Data Science Sandbox] is a free, cloud-based instance of Neo4j with GDS Community Edition preinstalled.

link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-data-science/[Neo4j AuraDS] is the fully managed version of Neo4j GDS Enterprise Edition which does not require any installation.

== Installation methods

You can install the GDS library in different ways depending on your Neo4j deployment.

* If you are new to Neo4j, a convenient option to get started is to install the https://neo4j.com/docs/desktop-manual/current/installation/[Neo4j Desktop] application first.
On Neo4j Desktop you can install the GDS library directly xref:installation/neo4j-desktop.adoc[from the UI].

* If you use any edition of the Neo4j Server (Community or Enterprise), you need to install the GDS library manually as explained in the xref:installation/neo4j-server.adoc[Neo4j Server] section.

* If you run Neo4j in a Docker container, you need to configure the GDS library as a xref:installation/installation-docker.adoc[Neo4j Docker plugin].

* If you run Neo4j in a cluster, you can follow the same instructions for the Neo4j Server with xref:production-deployment/neo4j-cluster.adoc[some additional considerations].

* If you run Neo4j in a Kubernetes cluster, you can add GDS to the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/kubernetes/plugins/#automatic-plugin-download[Neo4j Helm chart deployments].

.GDS Enterprise Edition

The Enterprise Edition (EE) of the library requires a _license key_ as well. You can find more details on requesting and configuring a license key in the xref:installation/installation-enterprise-edition.adoc[] section.

GDS EE includes Apache Arrow for advanced graph import and export capabilities. Arrow can be enabled and configured as detailed in the xref:installation/configure-apache-arrow-server.adoc[Apache Arrow] guide.

== Verifying the installation

To verify your installation, run the `gds.version()` function in the Neo4j Browser:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
RETURN gds.version();
----

To list all available procedures, call the `gds.list()` procedure:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.list();
----

If you have installed GDS EE, call the `gds.isLicensed()` function and check that the returned value is `true`:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
RETURN gds.isLicensed();
----

For more details, you can call the `gds.license.state()` procedure:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.license.state();
----

== Additional configuration

In order to make use of certain features of the GDS library, additional configuration may be necessary.
For example, exporting graphs xref:management-ops/graph-export/graph-export-csv.adoc#catalog-graph-export-csv[to CSV files] requires the configuration parameter `gds.export.location` to be set to the folder in which exported graphs are to be stored.

You can find the list of all the configuration options xref:production-deployment/configuration-settings.adoc[here].
Refer to the <<_installation_methods,installation methods>> for details on how to edit a Neo4j database configuration depending on the Neo4j deployment.

== Graph Data Science on MacOS

If you are running MacOS (x86 or ARM), it is currently required to add the following configuration entry to `neo4j.conf`:

----
server.jvm.additional=-Djol.skipHotspotSAAttach=true
----
