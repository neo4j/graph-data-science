= Additional configuration options

In order to make use of certain features of the GDS library, additional configuration is necessary.
Configuration is done in the _neo4j.conf_ configuration file before starting the DBMS.
The following features require such additional configuration:


== Graph export

Exporting xref:graph-catalog-export-ops.adoc#catalog-graph-export-csv[graphs to CSV] files requires the configuration parameter `gds.export.location` to be set to the absolute path to the folder in which exported graphs will be stored.
This directory has to be writable by the Neo4j process.


== Model persistence

The xref:model-catalog/store.adoc#model-catalog-store-ops[model persistence feature] requires the configuration parameter `gds.model.store_location` to be set to the absolute path to the folder in which the models will be stored.
This directory has to be writable by the Neo4j process.
