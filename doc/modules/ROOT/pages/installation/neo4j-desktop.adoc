After opening https://neo4j.com/docs/desktop/current/[Neo4j Desktop], you can find the _Graph Data Science Library_ plugin in the *Plugins* tab of a database.

Scroll down the list to find the entry titled `Graph Data Science` and press install.
The installer then downloads the GDS library and installs it in the `plugins` directory of the database.
This process should work for any version of Desktop.

== Configuration

[NOTE]
====
You can edit the configuration file for a database by clicking on the ellipsis (*...*) button and opening the *Settings...* menu item.
====

The installer automatically adds the following entries to the configuration:

----
dbms.security.procedures.allowlist=gds.*
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*

----

The allowlist configuration entry is needed to allow executing the gds procedures.

This unrestricted configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.

If you are running MacOS (x86 or ARM), it is required to add the following configuration entry to the configuration:

----
server.jvm.additional=-Djol.skipHotspotSAAttach=true
----
