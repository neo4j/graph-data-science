:description: This chapter describes each of the graph algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library, including algorithm tiers, execution modes and general syntax.


The Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library contains many graph algorithms.
The algorithms are divided into categories which represent different problem classes.
The categories are listed in this chapter.

This chapter is divided into the following sections:

* xref:algorithms/syntax.adoc[Syntax overview]
* xref:algorithms/centrality.adoc[Centrality]
* xref:algorithms/community.adoc[Community detection]
* xref:algorithms/similarity.adoc[Similarity]
* xref:algorithms/pathfinding.adoc[Path finding]
* xref:machine-learning/node-embeddings/index.adoc[Node embeddings]
* xref:algorithms/linkprediction.adoc[Topological link prediction]
* xref:algorithms/auxiliary.adoc[Auxiliary procedures]
* xref:algorithms/pregel-api.adoc[Pregel API]
