:description: This chapter provides explanations and examples for each of the influence maximization algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


The objective of influence maximization is to find a small subset of k nodes from a network in order to achieve maximization to the total number of nodes influenced by these k nodes.
The Neo4j GDS library includes the following alpha influence maximization algorithms:
