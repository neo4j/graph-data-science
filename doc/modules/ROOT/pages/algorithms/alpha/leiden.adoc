[[algorithms-leiden-intro]]
== Introduction

The Leiden algorithm is an algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.
The algorithm separates nodes into disjoint communities so as to maximize a modularity score for each community.
Modularity quantifies the quality of an assignment of nodes to communities, that is how densely connected nodes in a community are, compared to how connected they would be in a random network.

The Leiden algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm, that recursively merges communities into single nodes by greedily optimizing the modularity and the process repeats in the condensed graph.
It modifies the xref::algorithms/louvain.adoc[Louvain] algorithm to address some of its shortcomings, namely the case where some of the communities found by Louvain are not well-connected.
This is achieved by periodically randomly breaking down communities into smaller well-connected ones.

For more information on this algorithm, see:

* https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08473.pdf[V.A. Traag, L. Waltman and N.J. van Eck "From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities"^]

[NOTE]
====
Running this algorithm requires sufficient memory availability.
Before running this algorithm, we recommend that you read xref::common-usage/memory-estimation.adoc[Memory Estimation].

== Examples

:algorithm-name: Leiden community detection
:graph-description: social network
:image-file: louvain.svg
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-intro.adoc[]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source,cypher,role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (nAlice:User {name: 'Alice', seed: 42}),
  (nBridget:User {name: 'Bridget', seed: 42}),
  (nCharles:User {name: 'Charles', seed: 42}),
  (nDoug:User {name: 'Doug'}),
  (nMark:User {name: 'Mark'}),
  (nMichael:User {name: 'Michael'}),

  (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nBridget),
  (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nCharles),
  (nCharles)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nBridget),

  (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 5}]->(nDoug),

  (nMark)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nDoug),
  (nMark)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nMichael),
  (nMichael)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nMark);
----

This graph has two clusters of _Users_, that are closely connected.
These clusters are connected by a single edge.
The relationship property `weight`  determines the strength of each respective relationship between nodes.

We can now project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
We load the `LINK` relationships with orientation set to `UNDIRECTED` as this works best with the Leiden algorithm.

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-named-native-note.adoc[]

.The following statement will project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source,cypher,role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'myGraph',
    'User',
    {
        LINK: {
            orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
        }
    },
    {
        nodeProperties: 'seed',
        relationshipProperties: 'weight'
    }
)

In `mutate` mode, only a single row is returned by the procedure.
The result contains meta information, like the number of identified communities.
The result is written to the GDS in-memory graph instead of the Neo4j database.

.The following will run the algorithm and store the results in the Neo4j database:

In `write` mode, only a single row is returned by the procedure.
The result contains meta information, like the number of identified communities.
The result is written to the Neo4j database instead of the GDS in-memory graph.


[[algorithms-leiden-examples-stream-weighted]]
=== Weighted

The Leiden algorithm can also run on weighted graphs, taking the given relationship weights into concern when calculating the modularity.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm on a weighted graph and stream results:
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.alpha.leiden.stream('myGraph', { relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight', randomSeed: 19 })
YIELD nodeId, communityId
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, communityId
ORDER BY name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name      | communityId
| "Alice"   | 3
| "Bridget" | 2
| "Charles" | 2
| "Doug"    | 3
| "Mark"    | 5
| "Michael" | 5

Using the weighted relationships, we see that `Alice` and `Doug` have formed their own community, as their link is much stronger than all the others.
