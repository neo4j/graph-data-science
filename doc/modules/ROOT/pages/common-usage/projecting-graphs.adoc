:description: This section discusses creating named graphs to be used for algorithm computation in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


In order for any algorithm in the GDS library to run, we must first project a graph to run on.
The graph is projected as a _named graph_.
A named graph is given a name and stored in the graph catalog.
For a detailed guide on all graph catalog operations, see xref:management-ops/graph-catalog-ops.adoc[Graph Catalog].
