:description: This section explains administration capabilities in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


The GDS catalog offers elevated access to administrator users.
Any user granted a role with the name `admin` is considered an administrator by GDS.

A GDS administrator has access to graphs projected by any other user.
This includes the ability to list, drop and run algorithms over these graphs.


== Disambiguating identically named graphs

Sometimes, several users (including the admin user themselves) could have a graph with the same name.
To disambiguate between these graphs, the `username` configuration parameter can be used.


== Examples

We will illustrate the administrator capabilities using a small example.
In this example we have three users where one is an administrator.
We create the users and set up the roles using the following Cypher commands:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE USER alice SET PASSWORD $alice_pw CHANGE NOT REQUIRED;
CREATE USER bob SET PASSWORD $bob_pw CHANGE NOT REQUIRED;
CREATE USER carol SET PASSWORD $carol_pw CHANGE NOT REQUIRED;

GRANT ROLE reader TO alice;
GRANT ROLE reader TO bob;
GRANT ROLE admin TO carol;
----

As we can see, `alice` and `bob` are standard users with read access to the database.
`carol` is an administrator by virtue of being granted the `admin` role (for more information about this role see the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/built-in-roles/[Operations manual]).

Now `alice` and `bob` each project a few graphs.
They both project a graph called `graphA` and `bob` also projects a graph called `graphB`.


=== Listing

To list all graphs from all users, `carol` simply uses the graph list procedure.

.Listing all graphs as administrator user:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName
| "graphA"
| "graphA"
| "graphB"
|===

Notice that all graphs from all users are visible to `carol` since they are considered a GDS admin.


=== Running algorithms with other users' graphs

`carol` may use `graphB` by simply naming it.

.`carol` can run WCC on the `graphB` graph owned by `bob`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.wcc.stats('graphB')
YIELD componentCount
----

To use the `graphA` owned by `alice`, `carol` must use the `username` override.

.`carol` can run WCC on `graphA` owned by `alice`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.wcc.stats('graphA', { username: 'alice' })
YIELD componentCount
----


=== Dropping other users' graphs

Unlike for listing, the full procedure signature must be used when using the `username` override to disambiguate.
In the query below we have used the default values for the second and third parameter for the drop procedure.
`username` is the fourth parameter.
For more details see xref:management-ops/graph-drop.adoc[Dropping graphs].

.To drop `graphA` owned by `bob`, `carol` can run the following:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.drop('graphA', true, '', 'bob')
YIELD graphName
----
