| Name                                                                             | Type     | Default | Optional | Description
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String   | null    | yes      | If set, the values stored at the given property are used as relationship weights during the computation. If not set, the graph is considered unweighted.
| <<common-configuration-seed-property,seedProperty>>                              | String   | n/a     | yes      | Used to set the initial community for a node. The property value needs to be a number.
| maxLevels                                                                        | Integer  | 10      | yes      | The maximum number of levels in which the graph is clustered and then condensed.
| <<common-configuration-max-iterations,maxIterations>>                            | Integer  | 10      | yes      | The maximum number of iterations that the modularity optimization will run for each level.
| <<common-configuration-tolerance,tolerance>>                                     | Float    | 0.0001  | yes      | Minimum change in modularity between iterations. If the modularity changes less than the tolerance value, the result is considered stable and the algorithm returns.
| includeIntermediateCommunities                                                   | Boolean  | false   | yes      | Indicates whether to write intermediate communities. If set to false, only the final community is persisted.
| consecutiveIds                                                                   | Boolean  | false   | yes      | Flag to decide whether component identifiers are mapped into a consecutive id space (requires additional memory). Cannot be used in combination with the `includeIntermediateCommunities` flag.
