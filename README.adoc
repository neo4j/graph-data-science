= Neo4j Graph Data Science Library

This repository hosts the sources of the Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library.
The GDS library is a plugin for the Neo4j graph database.
The library consists of a number of graph algorithms, exposed as procedures and executed in Neo4j.

The Neo4j Graph Data Science library is the successor of the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.

== Downloading and installing releases

The latest releases of the Graph Data Science library can always be found at the https://neo4j.com/graph-data-science-software/[Neo4j Graph Data Science Download Page].
To install the plugin in Neo4j place the downloaded JAR file it in the `plugins` directory of your Neo4j database and restart the database.
For further instructions, see our https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/[documentation].

If you are using Neo4j Desktop you can simply add the Graph Data Science library on the plugins page of your project.

== Developing with the library

The Graph Data Science library is also available on https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.neo4j.gds[Maven Central].
If you want to include the Graph Data Science library in your own project you can simply add it to your project as a dependency.

For the most basic set of features, like graph loading and the graph representation, you need to include the `core` module:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>core</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

The algorithms are located in the `algo-common`, `algo` and `alpha-algo` modules:
```
<!-- Contains the basic algorithm infrastructure -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>algo-common</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Contains the productized algorithms -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>algo</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Contains the alpha algorithms -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
    <artifactId>alpha-algo</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

The procedures are located in the `proc-common`, `proc` and `alpha-proc` modules :
```
<!-- Contains the basic procedure infrastructure -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>proc-common</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Contains the productized algorithm procedures -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>proc</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Contains the alpha algorithm procedures-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
    <artifactId>alpha-proc</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Required by the Write procedures, this artifact is responsible for providing the various exporters -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>write-services</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```


== Building the library

The Neo4j Graph Data Science library uses the build tool `Gradle`.
Gradle is shipped with this repository using the Gradle Wrapper.
This means you can simply run all Gradle commands by running `./gradlew TASK` from the repository root.

Running tests::
To run all tests you can simply run `./gradlew check`

Packaging the library::
To package the library you can run `./gradlew :open-packaging:shadowJar`.
This will create the bundled JAR at `open-packaging/build/libs/`.
To use the bundled JAR in Neo4j, place the JAR file in the `plugins` directory of your Neo4j database and restart the database.
For further instructions, see our https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/[documentation].
