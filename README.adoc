This repository hosts the open sources of the Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library.
The GDS library is a plugin for the Neo4j graph database.
The library consists of a number of graph algorithms, exposed as procedures and executed in Neo4j.

The Neo4j Graph Data Science library is the successor of the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.


== Downloading and installing releases

The latest releases of Neo4j GDS can always be found at the https://neo4j.com/graph-data-science-software/[Neo4j Graph Data Science Download Page].
To install the plugin in Neo4j place the downloaded JAR file it in the `plugins` directory of your Neo4j database and restart the database.
For further instructions, see our https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/[documentation].

If you are using Neo4j Desktop you can simply add the Graph Data Science library on the plugins page of your project.

NOTE: Preview releases are not automatically made available in Neo4j Desktop. They need to be installed manually.


== OpenGDS

The Neo4j Graph Data Science library as built and distributed by Neo4j includes the sources in this repository as well a suite of closed sources.
Neo4j GDS is available to download and use under the constraints of its license.

However, the sources in this repository can be also be assembled into a fully functioning library, which we call OpenGDS.
OpenGDS is available to build, use, and extend under the constraints of the GNU Public License version 3.0.


== Developing with OpenGDS

OpenGDS is also available on https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.neo4j.gds[Maven Central].
If you want to include the OpenGDS in your own project you can simply add it as a dependency.

For the most basic set of features, like graph loading and the graph representation, you need to include the `core` module:

[source]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>core</artifactId>
  <version>1.8.1</version>
</dependency>
----

The algorithms are located in the `algo-common`, `algo` and `alpha-algo` modules:

[source]
----
<!-- Contains the basic algorithm infrastructure -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>algo-common</artifactId>
  <version>1.8.1</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Contains the productized algorithms -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>algo</artifactId>
  <version>1.8.1</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Contains the alpha algorithms -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
    <artifactId>alpha-algo</artifactId>
    <version>1.8.1</version>
</dependency>
----

The procedures are located in the `proc-common`, `proc` and `alpha-proc` modules:

[source]
----
<!-- Contains the basic procedure infrastructure -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>proc-common</artifactId>
  <version>1.8.1</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Contains the productized algorithm procedures -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>proc</artifactId>
  <version>1.8.1</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Contains the alpha algorithm procedures-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
    <artifactId>alpha-proc</artifactId>
    <version>1.8.1</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Required by the Write procedures, this artifact is responsible for providing the various exporters -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j.gds</groupId>
  <artifactId>write-services</artifactId>
  <version>1.8.1</version>
</dependency>
----


== Building the library

Installing JDKs::

Install https://sdkman.io/[SKDMAN]

[source]
----
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
----

Install both JDK 11 and JDK 17 Temurin:
[source]
----
sdk install java 11.0.13-tem
sdk install java 17.0.1-tem
----

NOTE: These versions were the latest at the time of writing these notes. To see a list of the available versions you can run `sdk list java`.

NOTE: You do not need to set them as default JDK

If you want to opt out of `Temurin`, you can override `javaLanguageVendor` and `javaLanguageVersion` in your project-local `gradle.properties`.
https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/jvm/toolchain/JvmVendorSpec.html[List of Gradle supported language vendors]

NOTE: The `javaLanguageVendor` and `javaLanguageVersion` overrides have to be installed locally on your system.


OpenGDS uses the build tool `Gradle`.
Gradle is shipped with this repository using the Gradle Wrapper.
This means you can simply run any Gradle task by running `./gradlew TASK` from the repository root.

Running tests::
To run all tests you can simply run `./gradlew check`

Packaging the library::
To package the library you can run `./gradlew :open-packaging:shadowCopy`.
This will create a bundled JAR called `open-gds-VERSION.jar` in the directory `build/distributions/`.
To use the bundled JAR in Neo4j, place the JAR file in the `plugins` directory of your Neo4j database and restart the database.
For further instructions, see our https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/[documentation].
